Problem:
Bars and restaurants want to make sure patrons are safe, so as part of anti-harassment campaigns, they have posted flyers in bathroom stalls and on social media with code words so that a customer may indicate to an employee that they are in distress. Sometimes, these code words also denote a preferred course of action, for example, to be escorted to their vehicle, to have an Uber or Lyft called for them, or to notify the police. The issue lies in the fact that publicizing unchanging code words has the potential to tip off harassers and increase the likelihood of violence and tense exchanges. Building an application that randomizes each exchange between patron and bartender or server ensures that the customer will get the help they need to safely exit the situation.

The SafeCode service functions by either registering as a patron or as an establishment. A patron who wishes to inform the establishment that they need help may send a signal to said establishment. Once the establishment confirms that they have received the signal, a random code word for each desired course of action (Escort, Uber, Police) is generated and sent to both parties. THe patron then selects an option and that response is sent back to the employee.
