# SafeCode
Anti-harassment application

Problem:
Bars and restaurants want to make sure patrons are safe, so as part of anti-harassment campaigns, they have posted flyers in bathroom stalls and on the Internet with code words that indicate to an employee that the customer is in distress. Sometimes, these code words also denote a preferred course of action, for example, to be escorted to their vehicle, to have an Uber or Lyft called for them, or to notify the police. The issue lies in the fact that publicizing unchanging code words tips off potential harassers and increases the likelihood of violence and tense exchanges. Building an application that randomizes each exchange between patron and bartender or server ensures that the customer will get the help they need to exit the situation.
